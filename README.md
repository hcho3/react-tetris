# hcho3/react-tetris

A simple Tetris clone made with React.js. I made it as part of learning React.js.

## How to build
First, download all JS packages by running

```
npm install
```

Then you can build the page with
```
npm run build
```

The Tetris implementation was adapted from [janbodnar/wxPython-examples](https://github.com/janbodnar/wxPython-examples/blob/b4337d1092b08415e9403767b782a63e955d07a0/tetris/tetris.py), in accordance with the BSD-2-Clause license.
